issue 1: draft didnt auto start when on the page. only updated when went to a different page and then returned

issue 2: i can still update league settings of leagues that have already drafted on the leagues page. this shouldnt be allowed

issue 3: the budget drafts have the budget at 100 regardless of what amount i set before

issue 4: the draft logic broke and it kept showing it was a bots turn and refreshing but the picks were not progressing
