# supabase/tests: SQL tests against real Postgres

The tests here execute migrations against a **real Postgres 16** (PGlite, Postgres
compiled to WASM, running in-process under Deno). The hermetic unit tests live next to
their modules in `supabase/functions/`. The tests in this folder are the counterpart
for SQL. PL/pgSQL resolves names only at execution time, so a migration that applies
cleanly proves nothing about its function bodies (`CLAUDE.md`).

They are **deliberately outside `supabase/functions/`**. That keeps
`deno test supabase/functions/` offline and hermetic, with no npm fetch and no WASM.

## finalize_league_draft.pglite.test.ts

What it does:
- Loads `supabase/migrations/20260926000000_finalize_league_draft_rpc.sql`
  **verbatim** onto a minimal replica of the schema it touches.
- Simulates Supabase's `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` grants to `anon`/`authenticated`,
  so the `proacl` assertion proves the explicit revokes work. `REVOKE FROM PUBLIC`
  alone would fail it.
- Drives the migration with payloads from the real planner in
  `supabase/functions/_shared/schedule.ts`.

It covers:
- grants and the pinned `search_path`
- the season-1 backfill and its idempotency
- the happy path, and a re-run that is a no-op
- odd rosters and `num_weeks` COALESCE
- duration leagues
- 14 payload/roster refusals, each asserted to write nothing and leave the draft
  `in_progress`
- partial schedule vs. partial standings
- season-N re-scheduling
- PR #9's leagues trigger contract
- the stuck-draft detector query in the migration header

### Run (from the repo root)

```bash
deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/
```

The first run fetches `npm:@electric-sql/pglite` (pinned in `deno.lock`) into the
Deno cache and the root `node_modules/.deno/`, which is gitignored. Later runs are
offline. No DB, no Docker, no secrets.

### PR #9's leagues trigger

The "PR #9 trigger" step loads `enforce_leagues_member_update_columns` /
`trg_leagues_member_update_columns` **verbatim**. It looks in two places:

1. `supabase/migrations/*_leagues_member_draft_complete_column_guard.sql`.
   PR #9 merged (`5e3b5d1`) with this file at `20260925000000`, so on `main` the
   step picks it up automatically and **runs**. Expect 25 steps passed and 0
   ignored.
2. The file named by `PR9_TRIGGER_SQL`, for older branches that predate the merge.
   Nothing is vendored:

   ```bash
   git show origin/main:supabase/migrations/20260925000000_leagues_member_draft_complete_column_guard.sql > /tmp/pr9_trigger.sql
   ```
   ```bash
   PR9_TRIGGER_SQL=/tmp/pr9_trigger.sql deno test --allow-read --allow-env supabase/tests/
   ```

If neither is found, the step reports **ignored**, never passed. So an unrun trigger
check stays visible in the summary.

## draft_pick_clock.pglite.test.ts

Loads `supabase/migrations/20261010000000_draft_pick_clock_and_queue.sql` verbatim, together with PR #9's leagues column guard. It covers the pick clock (trigger, CHECK, lock, deadline math, overdue list), the draft queue (RLS and `set_draft_queue`), grants (proacl, and in practice), and `auto_pick_search_candidates` compared against its TS mirror, which uses `effectiveCategoryIds`, the rule the pick gate uses. It also runs `docs/security/draft-pick-clock-effect-test.sql` itself. That is the file Giorgio runs in the SQL editor after the push, and every line must PASS here first.

## draft_insert_sites.test.ts

A structural guard. Only `insertGatedPick` (gated picks) and `insertSkip` (SKIP rows) may write `drafts`, and only `gatePick` may produce a `GatedPick`. It reads files only: `deno test --allow-read supabase/tests/draft_insert_sites.test.ts`.
